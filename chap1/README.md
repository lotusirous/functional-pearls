# Problem

Consider the problem of computing the smallest natural number not in a given
finite set X of natural numbers.

Suppose X is given as a list of distinct numbers in no particular order

```ocaml
X = [08; 23; 09; 00; 12; 11; 01; 10; 13; 07; 41; 04; 14; 21; 05; 17; 03; 19; 02; 06]
```

How would you find the smallest number not in this list?
